            <h1>About Me</h1>
            <p>Welcome to my portfolio! I am an interior designer with a passion for creating beautiful and functional spaces. My journey in design began with a love for architecture and aesthetics, leading me to pursue a degree in Interior Design.</p>
            <p>My design philosophy centers around the idea that every space should reflect the personality and lifestyle of its inhabitants. I believe in the power of color, texture, and light to transform a room into a sanctuary.</p>
            <p>With years of experience in both residential and commercial projects, I strive to bring my clients' visions to life while ensuring a seamless and enjoyable design process.</p>
